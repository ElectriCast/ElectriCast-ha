# Publishing Guide - Share Your Integration with the Community

This guide walks you through publishing your Home Assistant integration so others can use it.

## Overview

There are two main ways to publish:
1. **HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)** - Easiest for users to install
2. **GitHub Repository** - Manual installation, but works immediately

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### 1.1 Create New Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click **New Repository** (or go to https://github.com/new)
3. Repository details:
   - **Name**: `electricity-forecast-ha` (or similar)
   - **Description**: "Home Assistant integration for electricity price forecasting with solar panel optimization"
   - **Public**: ‚úÖ (required for HACS)
   - **Add README**: ‚ùå (we'll add our own)
   - **Add .gitignore**: ‚úÖ Select "Python"
   - **License**: MIT License (recommended)

4. Click **Create Repository**

### 1.2 Clone Repository Locally

```bash
cd /workspaces/weather-forecast/homeassistant-integration
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/electricity-forecast-ha.git
```

### 1.3 Prepare Files for Publishing

```bash
# Copy integration files
mkdir -p electricity-forecast-ha
cp -r custom_components electricity-forecast-ha/
cp README.md electricity-forecast-ha/
cp INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md electricity-forecast-ha/
cp hacs.json electricity-forecast-ha/
cp -r .github electricity-forecast-ha/

cd electricity-forecast-ha
```

### 1.4 Update manifest.json

Edit `custom_components/electricity_forecast/manifest.json` and update:
- `codeowners`: Your GitHub username
- `documentation`: Your repository URL
- `issue_tracker`: Your repository issues URL

```json
{
  "domain": "electricity_forecast",
  "name": "Electricity Price Forecast",
  "codeowners": ["@YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME"],
